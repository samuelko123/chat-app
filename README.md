# Chat App

I use this project to learn how to build a Blazor App.  
Inspired by [this idea](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/3-Advanced/Chat-App.md).

## How to Run

Method 1 - Run on Docker

```
dotnet run --project ./src/ChatApp
```

Method 2 - Run on host machine

```
docker compose -f ./docker/docker-compose.yaml up
```
